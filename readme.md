some data for testing and whatnot

simply require test-data in your repo and get some answers

```js
DATA = require('test-data')
```

PRs welcome. Just make sure you either:

1. made the dataset up
2. the dataset is public and you've cited it

For big datasets, please use dat.. or generate them with code. That'd be a nice thing to have here.
